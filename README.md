# OpenCV Canny Edge Detection

This project demonstrates how to perform Canny edge detection using OpenCV in a Python notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenCVcannyEdge.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd OpenCVcannyEdge
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebook/main.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform Canny edge detection on the provided image.

## Project Structure

- `notebook/main.ipynb`: The main notebook file that contains the code for Canny edge detection.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages.

## Example

The notebook will load an image, convert it to grayscale, apply Canny edge detection, and display the original image alongside the edges detected.
